To find the table name where the substring 'adfs' is present in MySQL across all tables in your 'crm' database, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'crm'
  AND TABLE_NAME IN (
      SELECT TABLE_NAME
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
      WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'crm'
        AND DATA_TYPE LIKE '%char%'
        AND CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH IS NOT NULL
        AND COLUMN_NAME IN (
            SELECT COLUMN_NAME
            FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
            WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'crm'
              AND COLUMN_TYPE LIKE '%adfs%'
        )
  );
```

This query works as follows:

1. It searches for tables in the 'crm' database where there are columns containing the substring 'adfs'.
2. It uses the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` view to look for tables and columns matching the criteria.

Make sure to replace `'crm'` with your actual database name if it differs. This query should help identify the table name(s) where the 'adfs' substring is present in any column.
