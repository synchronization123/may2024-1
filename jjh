Sure, you can add a function to extract the count of JIRA IDs from the response JSON. Here's an example:

```python
import requests

def fetch_jira_ids_count(jira_url):
    response = requests.get(jira_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        total_count = data.get('total', 0)
        return total_count
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch JIRA IDs. Status code:", response.status_code)
        return 0

jira_url = 'https://jira.crm.com/rest/api/2/search?jql=project=PE'
count = fetch_jira_ids_count(jira_url)
print("Total count of JIRA IDs:", count)
```

This function `fetch_jira_ids_count` sends a GET request to the provided JIRA URL, extracts the total count of JIRA IDs from the JSON response, and returns it. If there's an error in fetching the data, it returns 0.
