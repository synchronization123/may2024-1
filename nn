Certainly! If your domain is `https://dojo.squid.com` and you want to serve both your Django app and PHP files under the same domain, here's how you can configure Apache:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName dojo.squid.com

    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    # Proxy requests to Django app
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8000/

    # Configure PHP
    <Directory /var/www/html/php_files>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # Route PHP requests to mod_php
    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>
</VirtualHost>
```

Make sure to replace `/var/www/html/php_files` with the actual path to your PHP files directory.

This configuration assumes that your Django app is running locally on port 8000. Adjust the `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` directives if your Django app is running on a different port or a different server altogether.

After making these changes, restart Apache for the configuration to take effect:

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

This configuration will proxy requests to your Django app running at `https://dojo.squid.com` while serving PHP files from the specified directory under the same domain.
