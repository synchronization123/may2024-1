To execute URLs from an Excel file one by one and interact with a CMS using Python, you can use libraries like `pandas` for reading Excel and `requests` for making HTTP requests to your CMS. Here's a basic script outline for you:

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests

# Load Excel file
excel_file = 'your_excel_file.xlsx'  # Replace with your file path
df = pd.read_excel(excel_file)

# Assuming URLs are in a column named 'url'
urls = df['url']

# Function to execute URLs
def execute_urls(urls):
    for url in urls:
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print(f"Successfully executed URL: {url}")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to execute URL: {url}. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while executing URL {url}: {str(e)}")

# Call the function
execute_urls(urls)
```

### Instructions:
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed and install necessary libraries (`pandas` and `requests`) if not already installed (`pip install pandas requests`).
2. **Excel File**: Replace `'your_excel_file.xlsx'` with the path to your actual Excel file containing URLs in a column named `'url'`.
3. **Execution**: The script reads each URL from the Excel file, sends a GET request to the URL using `requests.get`, and prints whether each request was successful or failed with the corresponding status code.

Make sure your URLs are valid and that your CMS can handle the requests appropriately (e.g., authentication, permissions, etc.).

If you need more specific handling (e.g., POST requests, authentication), let me know!
