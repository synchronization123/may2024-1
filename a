If you're having difficulty finding the table name where the substring 'adfs' is present, we can approach this step-by-step to ensure we cover all possibilities. Hereâ€™s an alternative method:

1. **Search through all tables**: We can write a query to search through all tables and their columns for any occurrence of the substring 'adfs'. This approach involves dynamically constructing SQL queries for each table and column in your database.

Here's a MySQL procedure that can help you achieve this:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE FindSubstringInTables()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE tableName VARCHAR(255);
    DECLARE columnName VARCHAR(255);
    DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR
        SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME
        FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
        WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'crm'
          AND DATA_TYPE LIKE '%char%'
          AND CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH IS NOT NULL;

    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;

    OPEN cur1;

    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH cur1 INTO tableName, columnName;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;

        SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ', tableName, ' WHERE ', columnName, ' LIKE "%adfs%"');
        PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
        EXECUTE stmt;
        DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE cur1;
END//

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:

- This procedure loops through each table and column in your database (`crm`) where the data type suggests it could potentially contain the substring 'adfs'.
- For each table and column combination, it dynamically constructs a `SELECT` statement that checks if the column contains the substring 'adfs'.
- It counts the occurrences of 'adfs' in each column and table combination.
- To execute this procedure, you can run `CALL FindSubstringInTables();`.

### Notes:

- Make sure to replace `'crm'` with your actual database name if it differs.
- This procedure assumes that the substring 'adfs' is stored in a character-type column (VARCHAR, CHAR, TEXT, etc.). Adjust the `DATA_TYPE LIKE '%char%'` condition if necessary.
- Running this procedure may take some time depending on the size and number of tables in your database.
