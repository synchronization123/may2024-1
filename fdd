To import the issue and API key from an Excel (xlsx) file, you can use the `openpyxl` library in Python. Here's how you can modify the script to read the issue and API key from an Excel file:

```python
import requests
import openpyxl

# Load the Excel file
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('file.xlsx')

# Select the active worksheet
worksheet = workbook.active

# Read the values from specific cells
issue = worksheet['A1'].value
api_key = worksheet['B1'].value

# Define the URL
url = "https://sonar.anc.com/api/issues/set_tags"

# Define the JSON data
data = {
    "issue": issue,
    "tags": "abc"
}

# Define headers
headers = {
    "api-key": api_key
}

# Send POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

# Check response
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Request successful!")
else:
    print("Error:", response.text)
```

Replace `'file.xlsx'` with the path to your Excel file. Ensure that the issue ID is in cell A1 and the API key is in cell B1, or adjust the cell references accordingly.
