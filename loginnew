Got it. Assuming you have a database table named `users` where `user_id` and `role_id` are stored, you would first need to fetch the `role_id` based on the `user_id`. Then, you can use that `role_id` to determine the redirection. Here's how you can do it:

```php
<?php

// Assuming you have already connected to your database

// Assuming $user_id is already defined somewhere in your code
// Fetch role_id based on user_id
$query = "SELECT role_id FROM users WHERE user_id = :user_id";
$stmt = $pdo->prepare($query);
$stmt->execute(['user_id' => $user_id]);
$row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

// Check if the user exists and if role_id is retrieved
if ($row && isset($row['role_id'])) {
    $role_id = $row['role_id'];

    // Redirect based on role_id
    if ($role_id == 3) {
        header("Location: dashboard_leads.php");
        exit; // Make sure to exit after redirection to prevent further execution
    }

    if ($role_id == 4) {
        header("Location: dashboard_mentors.php");
        exit;
    }
}

// Default redirection if role_id is not found or not 3 or 4
header("Location: dashboard.php");
exit;
?>
```

This code first fetches the `role_id` from the `users` table based on the provided `user_id`. Then, it redirects the user based on the retrieved `role_id`, or defaults to `dashboard.php` if the `role_id` is not found or not 3 or 4. Make sure to replace `$pdo` with your actual PDO database connection variable.
